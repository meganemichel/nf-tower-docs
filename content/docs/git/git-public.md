As Nextflow data pipelines are simply Git repositories, these can be either public or private and hosted on any of the popular Git platforms: GitHub, GitLab or BitBucket.

Launching public hosted git pipelines simply requires adding the git repo URL in the **pipeline to launch** field. Note the revision numbers for the given repository are automatically loaded. By default, the stable `main` branch will be executed.
